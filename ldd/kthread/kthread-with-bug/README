This code is buggy. once you load this module you will never be able to unload it.
Calling kthread_stop() doesnâ€™t gives you a license to kill/stop the thread, 
instead it just sets the flag in the task_struct() of the thread and waits for 
the thread to exit.
The only way to remove this module is to reboot the system :D

Instead of using kthread_stop(), we shoud use kthread_should_stop().
same is in ../kthread-without-bug/kthread.c
